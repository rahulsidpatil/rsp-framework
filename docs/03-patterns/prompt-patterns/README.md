# Prompt Patterns

## Overview

Effective prompt patterns for common development tasks. These patterns provide templates and strategies for getting better results from AI coding assistants.

## Available Patterns

### [Requirements Extraction](requirements-extraction.md)
Extract clear, structured requirements from vague descriptions

**Use When**: Starting a new feature or clarifying ambiguous requirements

### [Code Generation](code-generation.md)
Generate high-quality code implementations

**Use When**: Implementing features, creating boilerplate, building components

### [Refactoring](refactoring.md)
Systematically improve existing code

**Use When**: Code smells detected, performance issues, or maintainability concerns

### [Testing](testing.md)
Generate comprehensive test suites

**Use When**: Need tests for new code or improving coverage

## Pattern Principles

### Be Specific
Clear, detailed prompts yield better results

### Provide Context
Give AI enough background to understand your needs

### Set Constraints
Define boundaries, requirements, and expectations

### Request Structure
Ask for organized, well-formatted outputs

### Iterate
Refine prompts based on results

## Quick Reference

| Task | Pattern | Key Elements |
|------|---------|--------------|
| New Feature | Requirements Extraction | Context, Goals, Constraints |
| Implementation | Code Generation | Specs, Tech Stack, Examples |
| Code Improvement | Refactoring | Current Code, Issues, Goals |
| Quality Assurance | Testing | Code, Coverage Goals, Edge Cases |

## Combining Patterns

Patterns work together in workflows:
