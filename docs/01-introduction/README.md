# Introduction to RSP Framework

## Overview

The RSP Framework provides a structured methodology for AI-Native software development. This section introduces the fundamental concepts and rationale behind the framework.

## Contents

1. [Problem Statement](problem-statement.md) - The challenges in AI-assisted development
2. [AI-Native vs AI-Assisted](ai-native-vs-assisted.md) - Understanding the paradigm shift
3. [Why RSP?](why-rsp.md) - The framework's rationale and benefits

## Key Concepts

### AI-Native Development

AI-Native development treats AI as a first-class participant in the development process, not just a tool. It requires:

- Structured workflows designed for AI collaboration
- Version control for AI interactions
- Systematic validation and quality assurance
- Reproducible development patterns

### The RSP Principles

- **Reproducible**: Every AI interaction can be replicated and audited
- **Structured**: Systematic approaches to common development tasks
- **Pragmatic**: Practical adoption strategies for real-world teams

## Who Should Read This?

- Software developers adopting AI tools
- Engineering leaders establishing AI development practices
- Researchers studying AI-assisted development
- Anyone interested in systematic AI collaboration
