# First Steps with RSP Framework

## Your First AI-Native Workflow

This guide walks you through your first structured AI interaction using RSP Framework principles.

## Step 1: Define Your Goal

Start with a clear, specific goal. For example:
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Refactor the data processing module for better performance"
- "Add unit tests for the payment service"

## Step 2: Use a Structured Prompt

Use one of our [prompt templates](../../templates/prompts/structured-prompt-template.md):

```markdown
# Context
[Describe your project, technology stack, constraints]

# Goal
[What you want to achieve]

# Requirements
[Specific requirements or constraints]

# Expected Output
[What you expect as a result]
```

## Step 3: Version Your Interaction

Save your prompts and AI responses:
- Create a `prompts/` directory in your project
- Document key decisions
- Track changes over time

## Step 4: Validate the Output

Use our [code review checklist](../../templates/checklists/code-review-checklist.md) to validate AI-generated code.

## Step 5: Iterate

Refine your prompts based on results. Document what works well.
